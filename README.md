## User stories
- As a member of FAC, I want to pair with coursemates who are of a similar level, to train on workshops
- As a member of FAC, I want to help form a strong team with coursemates who have different strengths
- As a member of FAC, I want to know which coursemates are best equipped to help me with a particular coding problem

### Whiteboarding / Planning

![](https://i.imgur.com/WKxd5eA.jpg)

### setup instructions
1. clone repo
2. `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Create a local database with `pgcli` or `psql` (see below)
4. `node db/db_build.js` to build the database locally, as we haven't made on on Heroku yet. **NOTE:** Uncomment the line: ```// dbBuilder();``` in ```db/db_build.js``` first.
5. `config.env`should look something like this:
```javascript
DATABASE_URL = postgres://admin:password@localhost:5432/express_yourself
```
6. `npm run dev` to run on port 1989. The year that [Express Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u31FO_4d9TY) came out. Our original project name.

### Creating a local database
1. run `psql` or `pgcli`
2. **CREATE DATABASE** express_yourself
3. **CREATE USER** admin **WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD** 'password'
4. **ALTER DATABASE** express_yourself **OWNER TO** admin

### Stuff and Things we did...

### DOM bits
- app drawer nicked from project earlier in the week
- hamburger menu nicked from [Colour Code, Week 1 project](https://github.com/fac-15/CC/blob/master/css/style.css)
- using [soundbites with DOM events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego)

### SQL bits
- SELECT LUNCH - Posting info to one table, returning the id to enter into another table [Select Lunch](https://github.com/fac-15/SELECTlunch/blob/staging/src/handler/postData.js)
- [can't send headers after they were sent to the client error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7042340/error-cant-set-headers-after-they-are-sent-to-the-client)
- problem with database connection (on Martin's laptop), had to install pgcli new version. Much frustration.
- did an INNER JOIN to get all user data from two tables in the database. Joined user_ids to retrieve names.

### Other stuff of note
- Lots of self indulgent CSS
- Posting data to server through the form
- Using a handlebars helper function
- ```Array.sort()``` method to sort by skill ascending
- replicating backend rendering in the frontend (see `public/index.js`)
- [HackMD with some bits and bobs in](https://hackmd.io/JkdM0tkhTRe9WfpVGBR3zQ)


### Things we didn't do:
